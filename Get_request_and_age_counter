#challenge: to perform a get request and from the data extracted which contains pre-existing parameter 'age' that how many values for age is greater than 50
import requests
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

r = requests.get('https://coderbyte.com/api/challenges/json/age-counting')
result = r.json()['data'].split(",")
count = 0
for data in result:
  splt = data.split("=")
  if splt[0].strip() == 'age' and int(splt[1]) >= 50:
    count +=1
print (count)
